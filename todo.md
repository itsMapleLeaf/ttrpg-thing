## assets

- multiple asset deletion
- dragging assets into scene as new actors
- import by dragging into window
- multiple upload
- idea: configurable default asset size

## scenes

- CRUD + cloning

## actors

- list them in their own panel w/ CRUD operations + cloning
- drag into scene
- actor editor popover thingy: edit name and variables
  - also list the scenes that the actors are present in
- variables, configured globally for all actors within rooms (?)

## scene viewer

- actor labels
- ctrl or shift click to multi select
- area select
- move selected actors by dragging
- resizing actors (probably only one at a time?)
- add actor directly to scene by dragging from file
- idea: show variables as bars like on roll20
- idea: visibility
